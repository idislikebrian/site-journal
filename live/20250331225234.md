Postmodernism made us care a lot about _intent_ — what the artist meant, who made what, and why. We picked everything apart, trying to find meaning under the surface. But now, with AI and algorithm-driven art, intent doesn’t seem to matter as much. Like @dystopiabreaker said:  

> “Some stemlords make a wiggly paintbrush and now the only thing that matters is mechanism.”[^1]

That’s what the _Ghibliverse_ is — a meme that doesn’t act like a meme. Still, it thrived in abundance, repetition, and emotional resonance more than originality. But it wasn't one image going viral. It’s a collective moodboard: peaceful, nostalgic, soft around the edges.

Memes used to punch holes in culture. They were weird, ironic, subversive. But now, a lot of them — especially the pretty ones — are more like decoration. They go down smooth. Nothing to argue with. Does that make them less artistic? Or just a different kind of art?

What if the Ghibliverse is folk art? We’ve entered a kind of post-scarcity creative ecosystem, where aesthetic participation is cheap, fast, and mostly unpaid. That doesn’t mean it's worthless — it means we haven’t yet built the right structures to support and preserve it. What would it look like to treat this seriously? What would resourcing it look like?

From an artist’s point of view, the Ghibliverse hits a nerve. It pulls straight from Studio Ghibli films — beautiful, handcrafted animations — and turns them into background scenery for tweets and TikToks. Usually no credit. Definitely no money going back to the people who made the originals.

This is what @dystopiabreaker is really warning about: the power behind the tools. Because it’s not just about people using images they didn’t make. It’s about who owns the systems that generate these aesthetics — Adobe, OpenAI, Disney. The same corporations that already control so much of the creative world are building the tools that shape the next one. That sounds more like consolidation to me.

So the question becomes: when does a piece of art stop being art and start being wallpaper? What happens when that wallpaper gets fed into a machine, and the machine spits out a hundred dreamy lookalikes in under a minute?

Some will say, well, artists have _always_ borrowed from each other. That’s how people learn. Isn’t AI just doing the same thing?

An artist brings something personal to the process. They have a perspective. A story. Even when they’re copying, there’s a layer of intention there — something only _they_ could bring to the table. AI predicts patterns. It assembles. It just fills in the blanks.

A lot of coverage around the Ghibli trend treats it like a neat turning point — a bullet-pointed signpost in the rise of “AI creativity.” Headlines praise OpenAI’s rollout and note that this moment “overshadowed” Google’s Gemini 2.5 release[^2]. Artistic labor — the hand-drawn craftsmanship that inspired all these vibes in the first place — barely gets a sentence. We keep hearing how AI will “redefine creative roles,” but rarely ask: _whose roles? Whose value gets erased in the process?_

And yet, even knowing all that, I can’t pretend the Ghibliverse isn’t compelling. Part of what makes it so sticky is how easily it blends with other internet languages. You can take an already existing meme and drop it into the Ghibli look, and suddenly you’ve got something new. You’re remixing. Maybe that’s art. Maybe it’s something else.

It brings up a deeper question: Does originality even matter if people don't connect with it?

Reggie puts it[^3]: maybe this is the first glimpse of “give me the new daily information dopamine.” Even when it’s beautiful, Ghibli posting — and the AI-fueled aesthetics around it — start to feel like slop. Not because they’re ugly, but because they’re uniform output at scale. The kind of content that’s engineered to be consumed and reproduced, not reflected on. What made Miyazaki’s style so valuable wasn’t just how it looked — it was how long it took, the stories it told, the care in each frame. Now, that value has shifted. It lives almost entirely in how we receive and remix the aesthetic.

Ghibliverse works because it doesn’t ask much of you. It’s familiar. Easy to repost. When everything looks good and makes you feel a little soft inside, it’s easy to stop asking _why_ it exists. Who made it. Who benefited. What got flattened or erased in the process.

If the end result is a stream of aesthetic moments with no story — no creator, no credit, no intent — what are we left with?

It’s easy to imagine this kind of moment being net positive — for Ghibli, for OpenAI, for anyone who had fun making something. But it’s hard not to notice that only established canon can spark moments like this. The meme only works because Miyazaki’s aesthetic is already universally recognized. It’s familiar. What about the living artists who are building new styles right now? They rarely get this kind of spotlight — partly because the models can’t train on their work ethically, and partly because the feed doesn’t reward unfamiliarity.

Dexdigi says[^4] (referring to Baudrillard), “The copy becomes the original.” That there’s now more fake Ghibli than real Ghibli — and that for many people, this is Ghibli now. Fair point. I think we also have to ask: if we’ve drifted so far from the source, what exactly did we lose — and what did we gain?

It's both simulacra eating the real/original and an invitation to look closer at how aesthetics function today — not just as reference, but as raw material. Maybe the goal isn’t to keep a pristine “original” at the center of all remix, but to make sure that original artists — especially living ones — have the means to keep creating. If the copy is now the canon, then canon itself needs to be more porous, more accountable, and less corporate.

This isn’t an attack on the meme itself. People want comfort, beauty, something that feels like a pause. But we should also pay attention to how that feeling gets packaged and passed around. If the end result is something with no story — no creator, no credit, no intent — what are we left with?

Ghibliverse is a mirror. It shows us how internet culture is changing — how we’re trading statements for aesthetic shorthand. If memes are art, they deserve critique. If AI is a tool for art, it needs context. And if “style” is the new language we’re all speaking, then we should ask who gets to set the tone .

Artists have always borrowed, copied, and mashed things together. But they’ve also always had something to _say._ That’s the part I don’t want us to lose.

> _This piece is inspired by recent trends in AI aesthetics, including “Ghibliverse” content. Unlike some takes that reduce this moment to a marketing problem or a novelty meme, this essay asks: what does it mean for art, intent, and the future of creative labor?_

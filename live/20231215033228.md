Welcome! This is my first entry.

This space is going to be a public journal. It'll be a range of things from personal development to moodboards, to case studies. 
### Why "Hello World"? 
"Hello World" is traditionally the first program one writes when learning a new programming language[^1]. It signifies the start of a new adventure, which is exactly what this blog represents for me. 

Thank you for joining me at the beginning of this journey. I'm looking forward to sharing more with you.

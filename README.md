# journal-repository

## Overview
This repository is the content management system for my personal blog, inspired by my friend Matthias's methods of using Obsidian with a Zettelkasten-based naming convention.

## Structure
- `/work-in-progress`: For blog posts in progress (Note: This folder is gitignored).
- `/live`: Contains the final versions of blog posts that are live on the blog.
- `/archive`: For older or retired content.

## Naming Convention
Posts are named using the Zettelkasten method, with each markdown file having a unique timestamp-based identifier for uniqueness and chronological tracking.

## Versioning
Updated versions of posts are created as new files with a new Zettelkasten ID. The original version's ID is referenced in the frontmatter for version history.

## Note
This system is designed for personal use, with the workflow tailored to my content creation and management process.
